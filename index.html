			<h3>Why Do I Care?</h3>
				<p>My Dad and Uncle started a local plumbing business 50 years ago. I know first hand how hard they worked to build their business and how hard my brothers work today to keep it running. Work didn't stop at 5:00 or on the weekends.</p>

				<p>Advertising was simpler back then. A quarter page ad in the yellow pages was a big expense, but generally paid off. Today, it's not that easy. People use Google to find what they need.</p>
				<p>To help your business succeed, you need to be found online with a website that represents your business and everything you offer. A  customized, professional website lets everyone know what you do, how you do it and where they can find you.</p>

				<p>You're busy building and running your business. Let me help you create the website that reflects your business and the value you provide.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I work as a user experience generalist and web designer in the Milwaukee area. I help make websites better for the customers who use them and the people who manage them.</p>

				<p>I have a deep seated passion for small, local companies and the unique value they provide to the community. I want to make sure you are getting the web expertise you need to help your business succeed.</p>
				<p>Along with helping you gather needed photos for your website, photography  is my creative outlet. I'm honored when someone <a href="https://cathyzoulekphotography.shootproof.com/gallery/artgallery/">purchases one of my prints</a> to display in their home or office.</p>

						<h3>My Process</h3>
			<p>I  will meet with you to learn about your business, what you do and who your customers are. Together, we will determine how you want your business represented online and what your prospective customers need from you. You will be involved in the entire process.</p>
			<p>If you need photos of your products, location or personnel for your website, I can help provide that.</p>
			<p>I will put these pieces together to design and build the website that reflects your brand and everything you offer. I will take your input and feedback, along with my experience, to create a solid, relevant website that will serve you for many years.</p>

			<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>I live in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin with my dog, Pixel. When I'm not doing UX work, I can usually be found working in my garden, walking the dog or <a href="https://cathyzoulekphotography.shootproof.com/gallery/artgallery/">taking pictures</a>.</p>

			<h3>Testimonial</h3>
			<p>Cathy Zoulek created our website for <a href="http://www.mandersframing.com/" target="_blank">Manders Framing Service</a> and we couldn't be happier.</p>
			<p>We've been in business for over 50 years and never had a logo. We knew the feel we wanted but no idea how to make that happen. After sharing this with Cathy, she came up with some great ideas right away. She brought exactly what we were hoping for, to life.</p>
			 <p>For our website, she listened to what we wanted and gave it the feel and flow we were hoping for. We've had several compliments from customers and a lot are new customers because they saw the website and liked what we had to offer. We would not have been able to get that information across so well if it weren't for her creative and concise layout. We would highly recommend her again and again.</p>
